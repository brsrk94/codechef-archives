## outer loop 
it counts the no of lines or rows we can say

## inner loop
focus on coloumns and connect them somewhere to the rows

## print 
print whatever you printing , inside the for loop only

## observe the symmetry[optional]


## example
    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i++){
        for (int j = 0; j < 4 ; j++){ 
    ```
    - here when i = 0 , j will be 0,1,2,3 
    - when i = 1, j = 0,1,2,3 again
    - it won't stop until the condition reaches i < 4
